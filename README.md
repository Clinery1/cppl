# What is this?
An experimental language I am making.
I was inspired by
[this](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/95126/how-does-a-static-type-system-affect-the-design-of-a-prototype-based-language)
Stack Exchange question, and the [Structural type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system) Wikipedia page.

# What does "statically-constrained-object" mean?
It means that the objects can contain any fields, but the possible objects are constrained at "compile-time."
See the explanation in `example.txt`.
If you have a better term for this, then please file an issue suggesting it.

# What is all this ugly code?
Please do not comment on that.
If I ever want to realize this language into something actually useful, then I will clean up and likely rewrite most of the code.

# What is this thing called?
CPPL.
It is an acronym for "Clinery's prototype programming language."
It is required to be in all caps when referring to it in a document, but file extensions are all lowercase.
