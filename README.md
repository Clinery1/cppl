# What is this?
An experimental language I am making.
I was inspired by
[this](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/95126/how-does-a-static-type-system-affect-the-design-of-a-prototype-based-language)
Stack Exchange question, and the [Structural type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system) Wikipedia page.

# Is this a memory-safe language?
While this is not the goal, I believe it is possible to make the language at least mostly safe.

# What is this thing called?
`CPPL`.
It is an acronym for "Clinery's prototype programming language."
It is required to be in all caps when referring to it in a document, but file extensions are all lowercase.
