# Uber-urgent (not really)
- ~~Syntax highlighting in Tree-sitter~~

# Urgent
- ~~Finish the parser~~
- Semantic analysis
- Compilation/JIT/interpreting or all of the above e.g., Cranelift
- Proper string formatting like char formatting

# Not-as-urgent
- ~~Converting parse errors to `crate::Error` for pretty-printing.~~
- Stage 2 errors: match against the grammar rule names and handle the `expected` fields in `ParseError`.
- Update README to reflect the current design decisions and terminology.
